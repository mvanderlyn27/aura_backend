You are a senior software engineer. .Ok, now look at @/docs/prd.md  and @/src/modules , Understand the tasks/logic needed full in the prd. We want to update the workout-plans-service   For AI related functions, use the gemini api, it should be available via the fastify.gemini,  (see @/src/types/fastify.d.ts ) Make sure that you create structured response for gemini so we can easily have json responses and extract necessary info to return. If you have any questions about what needs to get done feel free to ask. Also create any type that doesn't exist as needed, you can use the @/src/types/database.ts for info on the database structure
